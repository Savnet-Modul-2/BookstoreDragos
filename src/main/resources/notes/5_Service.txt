Service

Annotation:
@Service - marks the Java class as a Service;

Adjacent annotations:
@Autowired - used to mark a field for a dependency injection;

Definition:
A Service is a Java class that contains the business logic of a Java Spring Application.

Used in order to:
1. Encapsulate the business logic.
2. Reuse logic across multiple endpoints.
3. Make the project more maintainable and testable.
4. Keep Controllers focused on handling web requests.

Best practices:
1. Keep the logic focused
    - respect the SOLID principles;
2. Inject dependencies like Repositories or other Services via a constructor injection.
